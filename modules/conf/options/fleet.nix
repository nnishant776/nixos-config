        HEAD` states which revision the machine should be running.

          `null` means on when `conf.fleet.repo.url` is set and off when it is

          A rolled-back machine no longer matches its checked-out revision until
          upstream is fixed, which is a condition worth reporting. Turn this off
          to leave a failed activation in place instead.
